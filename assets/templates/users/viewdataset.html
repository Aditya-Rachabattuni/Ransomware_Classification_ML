      <p>
          Conventional detection techniques have been applied for
classifying various malware including ransomware. Various
ransomware can be analyzed by a well-defined behavioral
structure and most of the ransomware families share common
behavioral traits including payload persistence, stealth
techniques, network traffic. Signature-based analysis is the most
widely used traditional anti-malware system and A. M. Abiola
and M. F. Marhusin proposed a signature-based detection
model for malware by extracting the Brontok worms and to
break down the signatures, an n-gram technique was utilized.
The framework enables to detection of malware and creates a
credible solution that eliminates any threats. To improve the
limitation, a static and dynamic-based or Behavior-based
framework was introduced by where analysis static-based
technique analyze the application’s code to determine malicious
activities and dynamic-based analysis on the other hand
monitoring the processes to determine the behavior of malicious
intent and will be flagged as suspicious and terminated. Both
static and dynamic-based analysis has limitation in terms of the
inability to detect unknown malware and ineffectiveness against
code obfuscation, high variant output, and targeted attacks. F.
Noorbehbahani and M. Saberi focused on semi-supervised
learning for exploiting a number of labeled data and a lot of
unlabeled data towards detecting ransomware. Different feature
selection and semi-supervised classification methods were
applied to the CICAndMal 2017 dataset for analyzing the
ransomware and the semi-supervised classification method
using the random forest as a base classifier outperforms the
various semi-supervised classification techniques for
ransomware detection.

      <h1 id="stylesheets">Methodology</h1>
     <p>
         We applied traditional ML classifiers (e.g., decision tree
classifier, random forest classifier, naïve bayes classifier, and
logistic regression classifier) and neural network-based
architecture to detect ransomware.
The ransomware
data were standardized to convert different scale variable into a
similar range. Feature selection method was applied to select a
number of important features from the data and consequently,
feed the features into different classifiers to detect ransomware
from legitimate observations. We implemented 10-fold cross
validation technique to generalize the model. Finally, we
reported different evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F-beta
score, precision, recall and area under ROC curve to assess the
models’ performance.

      <h1 id="accessibility">Feature Selection</h1>
      <p>
          In the second step of feature selection, we checked the
multicollinearity of the high variance features using variance
inflation factor (VIF). A VIF score 10 was selected to identify
highly correlated features, meaning that a feature is identified
if the VIF score is higher than 10. Features:
SectionMeanRawSize and SectionMaxRawSize show
multicollinearity by displaying 19.52 and 19.48 VIF scores,
respectively. We randomly dropped one of these variables.
Table 1 illustrates the 12 high variant features with associated
VIF score, all of which are fall inside the VIF threshold. Finally,
we feed these 12 selected variables to the classifiers to detect
ransomware
